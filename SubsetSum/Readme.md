 * A dynamic-programming algorithm for the subset-sum problem which extacts:
    * The number of distinct subsets yielding the target sum.
    * The size of the smallest subset yielding the target sum and the number of such subsets.
    * The lexicographically first subset of the smallest size yielding the target sum.
 * The intput files to run this code are: 
    * [toy.txt](https://github.com/Ava-Mehri/Sample_Codes/blob/main/SubsetSum/toy.txt)
    * [electoral.txt](https://github.com/Ava-Mehri/Sample_Codes/blob/main/SubsetSum/electoral.txt)
