* Decision tree algorithm implemented from scratch
* The input file to run this code is [restaurant.txt](https://github.com/Ava-Mehri/Sample_Codes/blob/main/restaurant.txt)
* This code only works for the input files similar to restaurant.txt. I assumed all attributes' values are of string type, haven't consider the case in which attributes could have numerical values.
* For a different input file, change the list of Attributes in the code. (It is also mentioned in the code)
